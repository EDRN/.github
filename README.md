# üêôüê± Dot GitHub for EDRN

This is the `.github` repository for the [Early Detection Research Network](https://edrn.nci.nih.gov/), which defines the policies, various templates, default workflows, security reporting apparatus, etc., for all repositories for open-source software developed by the [Informatics Center](https://github.com/EDRN), a team from the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) and other institutions.


## üì¶ What's Here

Inside are files and directories that are used to provide reasonable defaults for interaction of and operation with [GitHub](https://github.com/), which is used by EDRN software projects. These include:

-   [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) defines our ethical standards.
-   [Code Owners Configuration](CODEOWNERS) tells GitHub how to assign reviewers to pull requests.
-   [Contributors' Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) tells how to contribute to our open-source projects.
-   [Security Reporter's Guide](SECURITY.mnd) gives information on how to report security-related problems.
-   The [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE.md) is the open-source license we've adopted for all our projects.
-   There's a [Pull Request Template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) that gives code contributors a way to make sure they've dotted all the `i`s and crossed all the `t`s.
-   And we have [Issue Templates](ISSUE_TEMPLATE) that give some default forms for filing issues against our repositories.
